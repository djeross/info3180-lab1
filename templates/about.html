	<h1>Rodje Ross</h1>
	<p>I am a bit concerned about my lack of work experience in the IT world. I have never been temporary employed
	or nor have I been an intern in a tech related company. I am worried that this might put me at an disadvantage when 
	it is time for me to seek employment. Hopefully I can gather enough knowledge from the courses that I am currently doing 
	so I will be able to attempt various exams to gain certifications in Database and Network administration.</p>
